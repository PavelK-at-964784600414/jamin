# PWA Icon Generation Script

This would normally generate the required PWA icons:
- /icon-192x192.png 
- /icon-512x512.png
- /apple-touch-icon.png

For now, placeholder icons are needed for production PWA compliance.

To generate proper icons:
1. Create a high-resolution app icon (1024x1024)
2. Use tools like PWA Builder or icon generators
3. Place icons in the public/ directory
4. Update manifest.json if needed

Current manifest.json references:
- icon-192x192.png
- icon-512x512.png

These files need to be created for full PWA compliance.
